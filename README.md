# 📏 Unit-converter

## ℹ️ About this project

This is a solo project that is a part of [Scrimba's Learn JavaScript Course](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript) by Per Harald Borgen.

At the end of every module, there's a solo project to practise all the concepts that were taught.

Every solo project has a list of features that need to be on the project, and a [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/cqtGul0V8RFXY4vTcIv1Kc/Unit-Conversion?node-id=0%3A1) to replicate.

In this project I had to create a Unit Converter to convert Length, Volume and Mass from the value inserted on the input.

The main goal of the project was to practise all the concepts learned on the course, plus the method `.toFixed()`.
